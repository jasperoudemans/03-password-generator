# 03-password-generator

## Description

This is an attempt at a password generator. It doesn't quite work but it gets somewhat close. 
Window prompts ask the user for an input of the number of characters followed by other prompts regarding
what kind of characters to include. The application first alerts the user to the sequence of true and 
false statements which corresponds to their responses to the prompts, then returns a line of commas 
equal to the number of characters chosen by the user minus one. I have not managed to make the password 
contain characters selected from my arrays of characters to replace the commas.
